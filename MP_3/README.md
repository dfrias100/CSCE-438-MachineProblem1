# Machine Problem 3

Howdy!

This folder holds my implaentation of Machine Problem 3 for CSCE 438.

The compiled binaries are included for your convenience, however you may recompile the program using `make` and you may run `make context-clean` to clean the context files generated by the programs. 

It is recommended to wait until the coordinator prints `System is ready to accept clients.` to begin testing as that's when all the servers have finished registering to the coordinator. 

The startup script `startup.sh` handles how the system sets up the processes, you may use `killall.sh` to kill all of the servers (this will not kill the clients however).

You may also run `make clean-no-remove-binary` to remove the context files along with compiled object files and generated gRPC code.

For your clients, please use port `9000` (the clients automatically default to this port). And the coordinator assumes the servers run on `localhost`. 

Binary list:
Coordinator - `coordinator`
Follower synchronizer - `synchronizer`
Server - `tsd`
Client - `tsc`
